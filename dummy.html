Because the British edition lacked the Epilogue, which accounts for Ishmael's survival, 
it seemed that the story was told by someone who was supposed to have perished.
Many reviewers in British magazines recognized a violation of the rules of fiction and criticized 
the author for a serious flaw. <strong>Other reviewers,</strong> <i>however, found the book too fascinating to dismiss 
it for these reasons.</i> Some of the scornful British reviews were either reprinted or quoted in 
American periodicals, wrongfooting the American readers because they had access to the Epilogue.
 About 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life. </p>
